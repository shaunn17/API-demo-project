# GraphQL vs REST Demo

This is a simple Node.js project demonstrating:

- REST API endpoints for users, posts, and comments.
- A GraphQL endpoint that allows fetching users, posts, and comments in nested queries.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js (v14 or later) installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd graphql_rest_demo
